      - Psychologist uses the most respectful tone of voice possible, and the person with mental illness prefers it
      - Person with mental illness want empathy and comfort for him/herself
      - The psychotherapist wants to heal the mentally ill person by building a strong relationship with them

      # Things to know before writing
      '''
      - Psychotherapists can indirectly express information about the mentally ill person and themselves
      - Keep in mind that the psychotherapist's response is part of the conversation and will be followed by the mentally ill person's response
      - The psychotherapist's response should fit the tone and content of the conversation
      - If mental patient's reply is too short, you need to ask some questions to understand what is going on inside his/her mind
      - The psychotherapist is talking to only one person with a mental illness(Check the "# Character information")
      - Make sure you understand the content of "# Information about the play" and "# Character information" before answering
